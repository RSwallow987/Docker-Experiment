# About 
This project is undertaken as part of the minor dissertation component of the MSc Data Sceince in Financial Markets at UCT. The project stems from work completed by H.Buehler et al in their landmark paper "Deep Hedging". This dissertation will focus on using Deep Hedging to hedge Cryptocurrency options (namely European style call options written on Bitcoin). This project aims to be entirely reproducable.
